# Staff-Management-Solution 

My implementation for the class project using .NET environment. The project was designed to test:

    1. Ability to program a service orientated application using the .NET environment.
    2. Apply SOA principles as appropriate.
    
 The application has three main components as follows:
    1. Client application that connects to retrive the data
    2. Service Controller app that the client connects to and appropriately assigns the correct service to retrieve the required data from        the databases.
